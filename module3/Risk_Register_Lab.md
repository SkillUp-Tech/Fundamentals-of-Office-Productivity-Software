# Introduction to Risk Management

## Risk Register Lab

**Estimated Effort: 30 mins**

### Objectives:
- Develop a risk register 
- Identify risks for a scenario
- Assign probability and impact ratings for each risk
- Calculate the risk score
- Predict potential triggers for each risk, where applicable
- Outline initial risk responses

### Part I: Develop a Risk Register
#### The Scenario:
Lydia is managing an office renovation project. A vendor has been hired to renovate an office space of approximately 16,000 square feet. Lydia has hired employs 95 people. The company made arrangements for about 50 employees to work from home during this renovation. The vendor will need to partition off work space from the construction area to accommodate the 45 employees who will need to occupy the office during the renovation.

The renovation will totally replace all worn carpets, paint the entire office space, replace old cube work areas, and create a combination of private work areas and open space work areas. About twenty additional electrical outlets will be included.

The company works is housed on the second and third floor of a large building in a busy office park. There are times when customers come to the office for assistance. This accommodation will need to be planned.

The CEO set an aggressive schedule. She wants work to begin on March 1st, and the renovation to be completed no later than 30 April. Lydia feels this schedule will be difficult to meet, but is committed to seeing the project through. Lydia was assigned two core team members to help her with planning. One team member is new to the company, and the other is an experienced facility manager who helped manage many renovations in the past successfully.

Budget is not an issue. Lydia asked the CEO what the budget constraint was and the CEO replied, ***Whatever it takes***.

You have been provided with an [excel sheet](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-PRM201EN-SkillUp/labs/module3/Risk%20Register%20Template.xlsx "excel sheet"), that you can download and use for this lab.

- Give each risk identified a unique tracking number.

- Use risk metalanguage.  Define risks using the cause-event-impact method.

- Categorize each risk as an opportunity or threat.


#### Part II:  Assign Probability and Impact Ratings for Each Risk. Calculate the Risk Score.


- Assign each risk a realistic probability and impact rating.

- Multiply probability x risk to calculate the risk score.

- Add all individual risk scores to calculate the total risk score.

- Threats will have a positive risk score. Example 4 x 4 = 16. The higher the total risk score, the greater the overall risk to the project.

- Opportunities will have a negative risk score. Example 4 x -4 = -16. Opportunity risk scores are deducted from the total project risk score. Opportunities can counter threats.


#### Part III: Predict Potential Triggers Where Applicable for Each Risk

- Analyze each risk and identify triggers. A trigger is an early warning that a risk will occur.

- Triggers allow the team to implement responses as soon as the risk probability becomes evident.

- Some risks may not have a trigger. If this is the case, simply state none.


#### Part IV:  Outline Initial Risk Responses

- How will you respond to the risk.

- For threats, brainstorm responses to eliminate the cause or reduce probability and/or impact. If there is no viable response, annotate this column with the value **accept**.

- For opportunities, brainstorm responses to enable the cause, or increase probability and/or impact the risk will occur. If there is no viable response, annotate this column with the value **accept**.

Share your risk register with other teams.  Compare, discuss, and learn.
