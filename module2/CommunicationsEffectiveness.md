# Information Sharing: Communications

## Communication Effectiveness Lab

**Estimated Effort: 30 mins**

### Objective:
• Review the scenario. Analyze communications issues in the scenario and make recommendations to improve communications effectiveness.

### The Office Reorganization Project
Eli works in the ABC company. He was selected to be the project manager for an office reorganization project. The goals of the project were to revamp the main office area to remove unnecessary items, change the organization of the office from individual cubicles to an open space environment, replace the existing carpet, repaint the area, and increase access to electrical connections. Eli was given a budget of $22,000 and 10 weeks to complete the project.

For the most part, the project was somewhat successful. The budget did exceed $26,000. There were a number of starts and restarts that resulted in lost time and additional hours needed to complete assigned tasks. The total project took 12 weeks to complete.

The project work was sometimes not clearly defined, and a few last minute changes needed to be incorporated.

Eli conducted a Lessons learned and the overwhelming number of stakeholders noted communication as an improvement area. Eli asked the team to elaborate and documented the following comments.

- Some stakeholders mentioned that information was delayed or lacked clarity. Eli did his best to communicate using e-mail. Unfortunately, some team members provided late feedback. In some cases, the messages were ignored.

- Eli used Teams to communicate and SharePoint to file information. Some stakeholders mentioned they weren’t familiar with SharePoint, and others complained they didn’t have access. A few members stated Teams was a bit confusing.

- Eli promptly forwarded all critical communications to the team. There were some stakeholders who worked different hours and others worked mostly from home. They stated that they were unable to access information on a timely basis and had to wait until Eli was in the office to access information.

- Eli did his best to get information to the team as quickly as possible. He scheduled meetings as soon as he determined they were required. Unfortunately, many stakeholders were unable to attend these meetings, and many critical communications were missed. Some team members stated that communications were too random.

- A few stakeholders mentioned that a few of the part-time hires identified problems but were reluctant to share them for fear their jobs could be jeopardized. 

- Eli tried to do his best to communicate effectively. He strived for face-to-face communications wherever possible. Eli assumed that the team had understood his instruction. As it turns out, some had a different interpretation of the direction compared to what was shared.

- A few team members shared they were not motivated. They thought this was a “busy work” project and really saw no benefits in working hard to them. Many of these team members had other jobs to perform as well.

- Eli did his best to conduct virtual meetings. Most team members stated they didn’t feel like much was ever accomplished. Eli did his best to make the meetings productive, but people were constantly talking over each other, many team members would conduct other business without muting their microphone, and it seemed as if everyone was on a different page.

So now for the challenge. Can you identify at least eight things Eli might do differently to improve communications effectiveness on the next project?

### Potential Solutions
| Communications Improvements  |
| ------------ |
|  Use different media. Eli relied exclusively on e-mail communications. Some stakeholders respond better to other media choices.|
| Communications technology blockers were at play. Access to SharePoint was an issue, and familiarity with the functionality of both Teams and SharePoint were a problem. Ensure the team is trained to use the communications tools pertinent to the project.|
| Eli used “Push” communications as his preferred methodology. He should also plan for “Pull” communications as well on the next project. Select stakeholders should be able to access project information as needed 24/7.|
|Communications should not be random but planned. Eli needs to consider creating a Communications Management Plan. Meetings should be scheduled on a consistent basis that allows stakeholders to plan ahead and attend.|
|Fear of conflict is a reality. The project manager needs to create an environment where all stakeholders feel safe sharing—even if what they share may not be perceived as positive. Working norms and ground rules that establish this safe zone could be a plus.|
|Eli needs to ensure the message sent was the message received. Active listening dictates that assumptions be validated through requesting clarification and paraphrasing.|
|Eli needs to find ways to motivate the stakeholders and team. Reward power should be used on future projects to determine ways to maintain and improve motivation and commitment. Rewards may be related to achievement, affiliation, or power. In some cases, a simple “thank you” goes a long way.|
|Communicating virtually is challenging. Eli should consider establishing ground rules and norms to reduce the risk of ineffective communications. Like it or not, virtual communications is a reality in today’s work environment.|
