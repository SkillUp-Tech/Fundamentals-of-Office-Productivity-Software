# Introduction to Risk Management
## SWOT Lab

**Estimate time: 30 mins**

### Objectives:

- Analyze a Brief Project Scenario

- Perform a SWOT Analysis

- Identify Threats and Opportunities

- Identify by Cause and Event



### Part I:  Project Scenario

The ABC Company is very socially responsible. This month they plan on supporting the Adopt a Highway program in their area.  A team of twenty volunteers will pick up trash and debris and place it into bags along a one mile stretch of Highway 11. The team consists of many workers aged 21 – 68.  At ABC, everyone tries to participate.  Giving is a part of the ABC culture. The CEO encourages all employees to be socially responsible as one of the company’s key values.

Highway 11 is heavily trafficked.  It connects two small cities.  The city will provide gloves, bags, and instructions on where to leave the filled bags of trash and debris.  The team chose Saturday morning from 8:00AM to 11:00AM for this project.

The team planned the event and sent an agenda to all volunteers.  ABC is providing some cleaning supplies that the city didn’t have available.  ABC will transport the volunteers in a charter bus from their headquarters building at 7:30AM to the highway site.  The bus will return to a designated pick-up location to transport volunteers back at 11:15AM. Volunteers will be treated to a pizza lunch when they return to ABC.

The long-range forecast for the Saturday of the event is only 20% rain.  It is May.  Normally the average morning temperature is 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit.  The team is hoping for the best.


### Part II:
